Aim - The aim of the project is to analyze global surface temperature data and other relevant factors to analyse whether the rise in global surface temperature is due to human activity or overall increase in volcanic and solar activities.The specific objectives include establishing temperature trends at various locations, deriving a global land-surface average temperature drift over time, examining the correlation between CO2 levels and temperature behavior, and investigating alternative causes such as volcanic eruptions and solar activity.
